This Weather App is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to enter the name of any city and get real-time weather information for that location.

The app uses the WeatherAPI service to fetch live weather data through an API request. When a user enters a city name and clicks the "Get Weather" button, the application sends a request to the WeatherAPI server and retrieves current weather details.  # weather-api
